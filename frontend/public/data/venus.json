  "description_short": "The hottest planet with a toxic atmosphere and backward rotation.",
  "description_long": "Venus is Earth's closest neighbor and second planet from the Sun. Despite similar size and mass to Earth, Venus has become a hellish world with surface temperatures hot enough to melt lead and atmospheric pressure crushing enough to require special spacecraft. Its thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with sulfuric acid clouds creates a runaway greenhouse effect. Venus rotates backward relative to its orbit and spins so slowly that a Venusian day is longer than its year. Evidence suggests Venus may have once had oceans and been habitable billions of years ago."
