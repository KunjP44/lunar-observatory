  "description_short": "An ice giant with extreme axial tilt and faint rings.",
  "description_long": "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and an ice giant composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and volatile ices. Its extreme axial tilt causes dramatic seasonal variations. Voyager 2 provided the only close-up observations to date, revealing a complex system of rings and moons. Uranus remains a target for future missions to study its interior, atmosphere, rings, and satellite ocean worlds."
