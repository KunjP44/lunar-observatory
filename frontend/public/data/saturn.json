  "description_short": "The gas giant famous for its extensive ring system.",
  "description_long": "Saturn is a gas giant and the sixth planet from the Sun, noted for its spectacular rings and many moons. Composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, Saturn has prominent banding and long-lived storms in its atmosphere. Its system of icy moons, including Titan and Enceladus, are of high scientific interest for studies of prebiotic chemistry and subsurface oceans. Major exploration was performed by the Cassini-Huygens mission, which greatly expanded knowledge of the planet, its rings, and moons."
