  "description_long": "Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and an ice giant composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and volatile ices. It exhibits powerful winds, dynamic storms, and a system of moons including Triton, which likely originated in the Kuiper belt. Voyager 2's 1989 flyby provided the bulk of our close-up knowledge; Neptune remains a high-priority target for future missions to study ice giant formation, atmospheric physics, and satellite oceans."
