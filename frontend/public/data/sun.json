  "description_long": "The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (yellow dwarf) formed about 4.6 billion years ago. Its immense gravity holds the Solar System together, keeping planets, asteroids, and comets in orbit. Through nuclear fusion in its core, the Sun converts hydrogen into helium, releasing vast amounts of energy that drive Earth’s climate and sustain life. Solar activity, including sunspots and flares, influences space weather and can disrupt satellites and power grids. The Sun will continue shining for billions of years before evolving into a red giant and eventually a white dwarf."
