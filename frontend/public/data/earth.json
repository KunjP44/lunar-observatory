Its unique combination of liquid water, atmosphere, and magnetic field makes it habitable. The planet’s axial tilt drives seasonal changes, while its dynamic geology shapes continents and oceans. Earth’s biosphere is interconnected, supporting millions of species. Human activity has profoundly altered Earth’s climate and ecosystems, making sustainability a critical challenge for the future."
