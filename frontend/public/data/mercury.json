It has an extremely thin atmosphere and extreme temperature variations between its day and night sides. Despite being closest to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet due to its minimal atmosphere. Mercury is a rocky, cratered world with a large iron core. Its rapid orbital motion around the Sun earned it the name of the Roman messenger god."
