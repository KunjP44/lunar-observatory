  "description_short": "The largest gas giant, dominant in mass and presence in the outer Solar System.",
  "description_long": "Jupiter is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, the largest planet in the Solar System. It has a complex atmosphere with powerful storms, including the Great Red Spot, and a strong magnetic field. Jupiter hosts a large system of moons, including the Galilean satellites, some of which (notably Europa) are prime targets in the search for subsurface oceans and potential habitability. Extensive exploration by flybys and orbiters like Galileo and Juno has greatly expanded our knowledge of the planet's atmosphere, magnetosphere, and interior."
