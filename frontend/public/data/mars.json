  "description_short": "The fourth planet from the Sun, known as the Red Planet.",
  "description_long": "Mars formed about 4.6 billion years ago and is the second smallest planet in the Solar System. Its thin atmosphere and cold climate make it inhospitable to humans today, but evidence suggests liquid water once flowed across its surface. Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, and features dramatic landscapes including giant volcanoes and canyons. Scientists are intensely studying Mars for signs of past life and as a potential future home for humanity."
